ticTacLife
==========

A simple framework for tinkering with AI written by John Serrano

Was inspired to make this by the question, "How would you decide who won a tic tac toe game with a board of N size?"
Wound up with a fun little framework for playing with AI.

The method takeTurn in class Turner is the place to put any AI code.

Compile TicTacLife.java and run.
